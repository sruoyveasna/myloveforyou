        <h2>Why is the answer always about you, Lyly? 🌸</h2>
        <p>
          Because ever since I fell in love with you, everything beautiful in
          this world reminds me of you. 🌍✨<br />
          The mountains, the seas, the sunsets—they all pale in comparison to
          your beauty. 🌄🌊🌅<br />
          Your voice is my favorite sound, your smile is my favorite sight, and
          your love is my greatest treasure. 🎶😊💖<br />
          You are the most amazing person I know, and being with you is what
          makes me the happiest. 🌟😍<br />
          Every moment with you feels like the most romantic place on Earth.
          🌹🌍<br />
          You are my everything, Lyly. ❤️<br />
          Forever and always, my love is for you. 💞
